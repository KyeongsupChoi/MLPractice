The dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, sex, body mass index (bmi), number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.\n","\n","* [Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis](#step-one)\n","We start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and examining its structure and summary statistics. The dataset comprises 1338 entries with no missing values. The features include numerical variables like age, bmi, children, and charges, as well as categorical variables such as sex, smoker, and region.\n","\n","* [Step 2: Model Training](#step-two)\n","For our initial model, we employ a Decision Tree Regressor. The target variable (y) is the insurance charges, and the features (X) include age, bmi, and the number of children. The dataset is split into training and validation sets using the train_test_split function. The Decision Tree model is trained on the training set.\n","\n","* [Step 3: Model Validation](#step-three)\n","We evaluate the model's performance on the validation set by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, we experiment with different values of the hyperparameter \"max_leaf_nodes\" to observe its impact on model performance. The Decision Tree model is compared against Random Forest, another ensemble learning technique, to assess if it can provide better predictive accuracy.\n","\n","These initial steps set the foundation for understanding the dataset and training models. Subsequent analysis and model tuning can provide further insights into the factors influencing insurance charges and enhance predictive accuracy.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"e01fd3b3","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-11T00:50:18.833896Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-11T00:50:18.8333Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-11T00:50:20.679016Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-11T00:50:20.677558Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.857894,"end_time":"2023-12-11T00:50:20.682985","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-11T00:50:18.825091","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from
