- ### [Supervised Learning]

   _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.

- ### [Unsupervised Learning]

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

	- [Disaster Message Classifier](https://github.com/): A multilabel classification model to predict the categories of a disaster message. Includes an ETL pipeline for data processing, a ML pipeline to train the model, and a web app, with visualizations, where the model can be used to classify messages. _Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Flask, Plotly_

	- [3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine. 

	- [Cross language Information Retrieval](https://github.com/): Cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, searches text documents written in English.
