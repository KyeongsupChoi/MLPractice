	- [Isolation Forest](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kyeongsupchoi/time-series-anomaly): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine. 

	- [One Class Support Vector Machine](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kyeongsupchoi/one-class-support-vector-machine): Gauging performance of a One Class Support Vector Machine to detect outliers on generated, experimental data. 

- ### [Deep Learning]

	_Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

	- [Image Classification](https://github.com/): A multilabel classification model to predict the categories of a disaster message. Includes an ETL pipeline for data processing, a ML pipeline to train the model, and a web app, with visualizations, where the model can be used to classify messages. _Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Flask, Plotly_

	- [Text Classification](https://github.com/): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
