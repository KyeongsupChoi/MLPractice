## Contents

- ### [Supervised Learning]

   _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

	- [Decision Tree Regressor](https://github.com/): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Random Forest Regressor  ](https://github.com/): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

- ### [Unsupervised Learning]

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

	- [Local Outlier Factor](https://github.com/): A multilabel classification model to predict the categories of a disaster message. Includes an ETL pipeline for data processing, a ML pipeline to train the model, and a web app, with visualizations, where the model can be used to classify messages.

	- [Isolation Forest](https://github.com/): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine. 

	- [One Class Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/): Cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, searches text documents written in English.

- ### [Deep Learning]

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

	- [Image Classification](https://github.com/): A multilabel classification model to predict the categories of a disaster message. Includes an ETL pipeline for data processing, a ML pipeline to train the model, and a web app, with visualizations, where the model can be used to classify messages. _Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Flask, Plotly_

	- [Text Classification](https://github.com/): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
